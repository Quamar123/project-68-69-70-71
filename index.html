                <p class="text-muted text-left">Students have books because the teacher cannot be with them at all times. Similarly, practicals in the labs are conducted to verify the theoretical knowledge. In other words, the labs and library are the logical extension of classroom learning. Bhashyam has in its library, a vast collection of books on different subjects, study materials, question banks and reference materials for the studentâ€™s reference. It also subscribes to several reputed journals. Bhashyam believes that, higher classes students should have sound practical training to substantiate theoretical expressions.The state-of-the-art labs for Botany, Zoology, Chemistry and Physics are separate and are exemplary.</p>

                <p class="list-group-group-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">The pattern of education in the higher sections of Bhashyam IIT Academy has undergone a paradigm shift and goes beyond the stipulated syllabus. It provides a stress free education while preparing the students for future Engineering and Medical competitive examinations. For IIT Foundation students, Bhashyam has designed interactive and practical based learning that includes group discussions, seminars and workshops. Several projects are allotted to students in groups and they are asked to make their presentations in the classroom after completing their project.

                    This will also give Bhashyam students a head start at the intermediate level to face the competitive exams like IIT-JEE, AIEEE, AFMC, AIIMS and JIPMER confidently and be assured of success.</p>

                    Bhashyam always believes that nothing can substitute parental affection and care.
                    The family bonding cannot be replaced. It can however be replicated through affection and love. Efforts have been made to retain the nuances of homely atmosphere.
                    The campuses are provided with excellent infrastructure with adequate landscapes.
                    As the academic block is close to the residential wing, the students get ample time to spend with their teaching faculty. This not only helps them to stay tuned with their academics but also strengthen their bond with teaching faculty.</p>
